            <p>A while ago a colleague expressed surprise in hearing that I had never played Advent of Code before and she warmly recommended that I gave it a try. So when December came, I asked myself "why not?" and registered myself for the challenge.</p>
<h2>Leaving ego at the door and enjoying the learning</h2>
<p>If I were to summarize my AoC experience as a first timer in a few words, I'd say it was fun, a lot of learning, but also very humbling. When I first approached it, my idea was to spend 1 hour per day, solve the first part, and move on (I decided that due to time constraints part 1 would be a reasonable goal), but boy was I wrong haha!</p>
<p>In hindsight it was not very surprising that some of the challenges gave me a hard time: AoC relies on a lot of concepts that one normally learns while studying Computer Science. And since History programs don't typically include algorithms or recursion, and I rarely had a need for them in my day-to-day work, it has never been a secret that they are not my strongest suit.</p>
<p>Was I bummed when I reached the first problem that shut me down? Absolutely! But then I shifted my perspective and realized what an amazing learning opportunity it was. Rather than trying to complete all the challenges as quickly as possible, I took a step back and focused on the cognitive process instead. In practical terms that meant reading up other people's solutions whenever I got stuck, looking algorithms up and learning them, and most importantly making sure I completely understood what was going on.</p>
<p>I am still not done with all the challenges (to be fair, I am also addressing part 2 now), but I am now the strongest I have ever been when it comes to things like algorithms and recursion.</p>
<h2>The more you play AoC, the better you become at AoC</h2>
<p>This might be an obvious one, but it is nonetheless worth mentioning. The more I played, the more I became familiar and quick in handling recurring tasks. Take parsing some sort of a grid as an example: the first time I wrote the code for it, then the next time I just reused what I already had, then I stumbled on a challenge that forced me to rewrite it in a more robust manner, but again that meant ending up with an improved helper ready to be reused, rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>Basically what I am trying to say is: if it's your first time playing and you feel slow during the initial task, just know that you will get faster in the coming days and years.</p>
<h2>Technical tests resemblance</h2>
<p>If you have been interviewing for software engineer position, you are bound to have stumbled on some kind of automatically-evaluated programming test of sort. I am personally not a huge fan of those (neither as an interviewer nor as a candidate), but if your are interviewing around they are hard to avoid. What struck me is how much those tests resemble parts of what I had to implement for Advent of Code. Don't get me wrong, you can totally pass those tests without any AoC experience. Though if I had played AoC before, I'd have probably been a lot quicker in solving them. And that means less of my time spent on them, which to me is a huge win - especially when you are in more than one interview process!</p>
