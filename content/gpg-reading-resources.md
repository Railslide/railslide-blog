Summary: A bunch of pretty awesome reading resources about GPG and cryptography.

While setting up my GPG keyring, I stumbled upon quite some interesting reading resources about PGP/GPG and cryptography in general. I collected them in this blog post in case they could come in handy for someone else or for future reference.

Happy reading!
