Summary: Setting up a repository for dotfiles is a rad way to store and port settings and configuration files. This is how I set the repo up and delegated the task of creating symlinks to the computer.
Status: draft

Michael Smalley wrote an amazing tutorial for managing dotfiles and creating a script for automagically installing them (go and check it out!), which provided me with a great starting point. However, the fact that his script handles only the dotfiles housed in the home directory didn't really get together with my goal of adding my Sublime Text settings to my dotfiles repo.
