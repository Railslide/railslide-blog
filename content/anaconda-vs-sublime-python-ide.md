Summary: When I was looking for a python code linting plugin for Sublime Text 3, I stumbled upon several blog posts mentioning either Sublime Python IDE or Anaconda. The problem was, however, that a comparison between the two was nowhere to be found, so I ended up trying both.

When I was looking for a python code linting plugin for Sublime Text 3, I stumbled upon several blog posts mentioning either Sublime Python IDE or Anaconda. The problem was, however, that a comparison between the two was nowhere to be found, so I ended up trying both.

The first thing that I have to acknowledge is that they are both very good when it comes to code linting and I haven't really noticed any difference on that side. So, no matter which one you choose, you can't really go wrong.
