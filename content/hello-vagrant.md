Summary:
Status: draft

For a long time my first step for starting a PHP based project has been to install Xampp on my machine. Xampp provides a considerably easy-to-install full lamp stack - no question about that. However, when I started working on a bit more complicated which implied to work together with other developers issues started rising.

The main problem was the differences between my local environment and the production one. Add the a further layer of differences for potentially each person involved in the project and it doesn't take much to figure out that moving the result of your work somewhere else than your machine was a guaranteed headache.

Enter Vagrant.
