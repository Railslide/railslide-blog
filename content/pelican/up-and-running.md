Summary: Celebrating the first post of the blog and what to do next.

Ok, my Pelican and GitHub pages powered blog seems to be up and running! Yay!

Since I plan to write a dedicated post about the setup, I'll use this one to throw some ideas about what to do next.


TO DO (not necessarily in this order)
-------------------------------------

* Change theme - ideally developing my own
* Fix links, social buttons, etc.
* Fix an about page
* Setting up a comment system
* Write stuff
